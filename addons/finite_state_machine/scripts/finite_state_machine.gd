extends Node


## Node that represents an implementation of the finite state machine pattern.
## Nodes that represent states need to be added as children of this node.


## Signal emitted every time the current state is changed. 'new_state' is the new state node.
## This signal won't be emitted for the state machine's initial state or when the node is not in
## the scene tree to prevent the signal from being emitted more than once for the same change.
signal state_changed(new_state: StateMachineState)


## The state machine's current state.
## Setting this state will call 'on_exit' on the previous state and 'on_enter' on the new state.
## Assigning a state from the inspector allows to select an initial state.
## Can be set to 'null' to clear the current state and stop the state machine.
